### Local Image Feature

* An interesting part of an image
* A starting point of many computer vision algorithms

### Use of Local Image Features

* Stereo Matching
* 3D Reconstruction
* Image Stitching

### Good Local Feature (Interest Point)

* Good local feature should be unambiguous for matching

### Conditions to be a good local visual-feature

* Repeatability (반복성): The same feature should be detected in many images of the same scene.
* Saliency (특징성): A feature includes an interesting part of an image.
* Locality (지역성): A feature occupies a small area in an image.

### Convolution (Linear Filtering)

* Convolution output is a linear combination of input.
* Smoothing, Sharpening, Gradient, ...
